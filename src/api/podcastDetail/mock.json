If you've openly wondered why concert tickets seemingly have gotten more confusing and expensive, this episode's for you.\n\n–\n\nContent creator and head of the Beyhive Kalen Allen is more than OK spending four thousand dollars on one ticket for Beyoncé’s Renaissance tour. 2023 feels like a big year for huge stadium tours for artists like Beyoncé, Taylor Swift, Bruce Springsteen, Ed Sheeran and more. But why are tickets so expensive, and how much are fans willing to put up with in order to go? Sam talks with music journalist Nate Rogers about why the touring industry might just be broken and what lawmakers and some artists are trying to do to fix it.\nLearn more about your ad choices.

      "description": "Vulture might have killed the song of the summer back in 2016, but if you’re a member of the LGBTQ+ community, it’s hard to argue against “Padam Padam” by Kylie Minogue. The track, released this May, has taken the queer community by storm, quickly becoming ubiquitous and inescapable – it's hard to even scroll on Twitter without a well-timed meme about the \"padam-ic\" popping up on the timeline. However, Minogue's song hasn't even cracked the Billboard Hot 100; instead, its status has morphed into that of a \"gay anthem,\" a song widely celebrated inside the community but unable to garner longstanding success outside of it.\n\nThis episode of Switched on Pop, producer Reanna Cruz tackles a question that the LGBTQ+ community has debated over for decades: what makes a gay anthem? Through talking with everyone from academics to their close friends, the answer takes us from Judy Garland to 1920s cabaret to, of course, \"Padam Padam.\"\n\nSongs Discussed:\n\nKylie Minogue – Padam Padam\n\nÉdith Piaf – Padam padam\n\nKylie Minogue – Supernova\n\nMischa Spoliansky – Das lila Lied (The Lavender Song)\n\nQueen – I Want To Break Free\n\nLady Gaga – Born This Way\n\nLondon Philharmonic Choir – Amazing Grace\n\nTraditional – God Save The King\n\nQueen – We Are The Champions\n\nTom Robinson Band – Glad to be Gay\n\nDiana Ross – I'm Coming Out\n\nJudy Garland – Alone Together (Live At Carnegie Hall/1961)\n\nCountess Luann – Chic C'est La Vie\n\nJudy Garland – The Trolley Song\n\nLady Gaga – La Vie En Rose\n\nBronski Beat – Smalltown Boy\n\nVillage People – Y.M.C.A.\n\nSylvester – You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real)\n\nMiquel Brown – So Many Men, So Little Time\n\nDepeche Mode – Never Let Me Down Again\n\nThe Weather Girls – It's Raining Men\n\nGloria Gaynor – I Will Survive\n\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.

      "description": "As summer comes upon us, it’s time for some Billboard shake ups. On this week’s edition of Chartbreakers, we’re looking at the recent iterations of the Hot 100 and a trend that has slowly been creeping up in popularity over the past few months: the influx of regional Mexican music. The past two years have seen many songs by Mexican artists making their way onto Billboard, all managing to highlight different scenes and sounds from the different states in Mexico. \n\nWe’re joined this week by the cohost of the NPR Music podcast Alt. Latino, Anamaria Sayre, who says that Mexican regional, or simply, regional, is a marketing “bucket term” that encompasses different Latin genres including everything from norteño to corridos, all genres that are comfortably finding a home in the top 20 of the Hot 100 in 2023.\n\nOf course, there’s more happening outside of Latin music. Much of the chart has been stagnant since our last iteration of Chartbreakers, but, as always, there’s been some shake ups thanks to the world of the TikTok sped-up remix, the legacy artist, and on some occasions, a mix of both (we’re looking at you, Miguel).\n\nSongs Discussed:\n\nEslabon Armado, Peso Pluma – Ella Baila Sola\n\nBizarrap, Peso Pluma – Peso Pluma: Bzrp Music Sessions, Vol. 55\n\nGrupo Frontera, Bad Bunny – un x100to\n\nFuerza Regida – TQM\n\nGrupo Frontera, Fuerza Regida – Bebe Dame\n\nLos Tigres del Norte – Prisión De Amor\n\nChalino Sanchez, Banda Brava – Alma Enamorada\n\nChalino Sanchez, Los Amables Del Norte – El Crimen De Culiacán\n\nRamon Ayala y Sus Bravos del Norte – Solo Una Patada\n\nGrupo Firme, Junior H – Tronando Ligas\n\nBanda MS de Sergio Lizárraga – Que Bendición\n\nDannyLux – Mi Otra Mitad\n\nNatanael Cano – Pacas De Billetes\n\nMiguel – Sure Thing\n\nFIFTY FIFTY – Cupid\n\nLana del Rey – Say Yes to Heaven\n\nTaylor Swift, Ice Spice – Karma (ft.

      "description": "In the song \"Touch\" from Daft Punk's final studio album, 2013's Random Access Memories, featured artist Paul Williams sings a line that augured the end of an impressive collaboration: \"I need something more.\" With RAM, Daft Punk pulled out all the stops, going the opposite direction of their previous albums, to \"give life back to music\" and bestow hearts and souls upon their robotic doppelgängers.\nRAM features almost no samples or programmed digital instruments, instead leaning into extensive collaborations with legendary studio musicians, iconic producers like Nile Rodgers, and modern mavens such as Pharrell. The making of RAM followed the blueprint of classic albums from what Daft Punk called \"the golden age\" of recording—Fleetwood Mac, the Eagles, Pink Floyd. The duo spent over a million dollars, held five years of studio sessions, and painstakingly crafted each track. The result was a record that helped usher in a retro disco-funk revival across pop music and generated a smash hit in \"Get Lucky.\" The band had perhaps crafted their magnum opus—but did it also represent the conclusion of their epic narrative of the battle between human and machine?\nSongs Discussed\nDaft Punk - Give Life Back to Music\nDaft Punk - Lose Yourself to Dance (feat.

      "description": "Throughout their legendary career, Daft Punk continued to prove that the more robotic their music became, the more human they sounded. This dichotomy came to a head on their third album, aptly titled Human After All. Where their past two records wired their circuits and gave the robots a voice, on Human After All, Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo gave Daft Punk sentience. On Human After All robots rock, but they also question their rigid programming. The record's ensuing tour and resulting live album, Alive 2007, furthered the narrative by ushering in a new age of live electronic performance. The impact of these two records range from the development of EDM to everlasting hits like “Technologic.” On episode three of our Listening 2 Daft Punk series, we take a look at these two records, and how both Alive and Human After All imbued the robots with super intelligence.\n\nSongs Discussed\n\nDaft Punk - Human After All\n\nDaft Punk - The Prime Time of Your Life\n\nDaft Punk - Robot Rock\n\nBreakwater - Release the Beast\n\nDaft Punk - Steam Machine\n\nDaft Punk - The Brainwasher\n\nBlack Sabbath - Iron Man\n\nDaft Punk - Technologic\n\nDaft Punk - Emotion\n\nJohn Williams – Wild Signals\n\nDaft Punk – Touch It / Technologic\n\nDaft Punk – Oh Yeah\n\nDaft Punk – Technologic\n\nBusta Rhymes – Touch It\n\nDaft Punk – Around the World / Harder Better Faster Stronger\n\nDaft Punk – Face to Face / Short Circuit\n\nDaft Punk – Da Funk / Daftendirekt\n\nKanye West – Stronger\n\nKanye West – On Sight\n\nDaft Punk – Human After All / Together / One More Time / Music Sounds Better With You\n\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.

The world-beating smash “Get Lucky” broke streaming records, forged a retro sound that still dominates the charts, and paved the way for artists like The Weeknd, Dua Lipa and Lizzo to craft their own throwback hits. How did Daft Punk do it? Switched On Pop’s four part-mini series Listening 2: Daft Punk unlocks the sounds, voices, and stories across all four of the group’s studio albums. On their first album, Homework, Daft Punk stretched the boundaries of electronic music and began wiring the circuits that would become their robot alter-egos, asking a fundamental question: where does the human end and the machine begin?\n\nSongs Discussed\n\n​​Daft Punk - Give Life Back to Music\n\nDaft Punk - Get Lucky (feat.

      "description": "When trouble strikes in music town, there’s one guy who gets the call. That’s me, Joe Treble, forensic musicologist. This week, I've got one of the most shocking cases I've ever worked. Someone killed the key change in pop music, and I’m going to do whatever it takes to find the perpetrator.\nThe key change used to be at large on the Billboard charts. From the 1950s to the 1990s, 20-30% of all number one hits featured one. In Whitney Houston’s “I Wanna Dance With Somebody,\" the key change hits right before the final chorus. The song’s harmonic center shifts up, raising the pitch of the song, challenging the vocalist to hit higher and higher notes, juicing the big finish with excitement and pep. But starting in the 1990s the key change virtually disappeared from the Hot 100. Now, hit songs start and end in the same key, and no one seems to have even noticed. Except for me.\nThis investigation will bring me face to face with a rogue's gallery of suspects and sources: Chris Dalla Riva, music and data specialist; Brandon McFarland, alias 1-O.A.K., producer; Emily King, singer and songwriter. Each interrogation brings me closer to revealing the murderer, but will I be able to handle the terrible truth? Tune in as I tackle the hardest case of my career: the case of the missing key change!\n\nSongs Discussed\nEmily King - Georgia Sleepwalker, Medal, The Way that You Love Me\nYG, Kamaiyah, RJ, Mitch, Ty Dolla $ign - Do Yo Dance (feat. Kamaiyah, RJ, Mitch, Ty Dolla $ign)\nBeyoncé - Love On Top\nBon Jovi - Livin' On A Prayer\nWhitney Houston - I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)\nFrank Sinatra - Strangers In The Night\nLearn more about your ad choices.

      "description": "We have an emergency podcast drop because the biggest and fastest moving story on the internet right now is about a song called “Heart On My Sleeve.” The track sounds like it was made by the producer Metro Boomin featuring Drake and The Weeknd. It might be one of the most consequential songs in music history because it was actually a fake, made with artificial intelligence. The blowback from this song has been enormous and a bit confusing. So host Charlie Harding went on The Vergecast podcast to break down how this song was likely made, and what it might mean for the music industry, the tech industry and all of our intellectual property. \n\n\nListen to the whole episode on The Vergecast\n\n\nRead Alex Cranz's story on Laser Bongs on The Verge\n\n\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.

      "description": "The South Korean idol group BTS is one of the biggest musical sensations in history. They're constantly breaking records and they have one of the most dedicated fan bases in the world known as Army. Their hit singles like “Boy With Love,” “Dynamite,” and “Butter” have been discussed on the show in the past for breaking through the US charts. But back in 2022, they decided to take a break from group activities and start releasing solo material because of their obligations to each fulfill mandatory military service in South Korea, precluding them from working together at the same time. Solo projects aren’t new for the group – BTS members have released mixtapes as far back as 2015 and countless solo singles – but this was the first time that BTS had ever announced a prolonged break. This moment, originally presented as a hiatus, has evolved into a whole new musical chapter for the group, with a seemingly endless array of new solo releases. Switched On Pop listens back to one track from each solo effort so far to introduce the casual listener to what is happening in this new era of BTS. Joining the show is Lenika Cruz, senior editor at The Atlantic, who literally wrote the book on BTS, simply called On BTS out on the Atlantic Editions imprint.\n\nSongs Discussed:\n\nj-hope, J.

Together, their song “Shakira: BZRP Music Sessions, Vol. 53,” is layered with musical and lyrical references, from the callbacks to “She Wolf” to the multiple beat switches. It also works to play into something larger: something akin to a pop music conspiracy.

      "description": "If you’ve ever learned classical piano, you probably tried to play one of Bach’s Inventions. The composer wrote fifteen pieces containing the most important fifteen keys in order to teach his son the fundamentals of piano and composition. Today, they remain some of the most popular pieces of piano music. Acclaimed jazz pianist Dan Tepfer recently revisited his childhood music books seeing them in a way he’d never realized as a student: the Inventions are much more than novice piano works.\n\nFor Tepfer, each of the Inventions not only highlight masterful command over harmony and counterpoint, but also contain moving character arcs that resemble the hero’s journey. A character is introduced at home in place of safety in act I. And then they are thrust into chaos and must overcome unsurmountable challenges in Act II. Finally, in Act III, our hero overcomes their final battle and returns home transformed by the journey. Once Tepfer heard this character arc, he started to apply it to his own free improv.\n\nThrough studying Bach, Tepfer conceived a new album: Inventions / Reinventions. In this project Tepfer fills in the missing keys from the Bach to complete all twenty four keys (there are twelve major and twelve minor keys) while updating the music with modern improvisation. In this conversation Tepfer walks co-host Charlie Harding through his process of playing Bach and applying it to jazz improv.\n\nListen to Dan Tepfer’s Inventions / Reinventions on StorySound Records\nListen to Into It with Sam Sanders on Fair Use\nLearn more about your ad choices.

      "description": "Everyone will describe the music of 100 gecs differently. To some, Dylan Brady and Laura Les make deeply satisfying earworms, tracks able to scratch the itches that occupy the deepest memory-holed corners of the brain. To others, though, their music is an \"anarchic assault on the ears,” a quilt of all of the genres historically ridiculed in the popular canon: nu-metal, scuzz-rock, ska and 90’s pop punk are all fair game in the world of gecs.\n\nOn their latest record, aptly titled 10000 gecs, Brady and Les double down on the crunchy distortion and harmonics, creating tracks equally influenced by Primus and Eddie Van Halen as they are by their hyperpop contemporaries. The album reflects a Internet-core approach to music as a whole, shedding notions of “good” and “bad” music in favor of catchy melodies and intricate song construction. \n\nOn this episode on Switched On Pop, we dig deep into the ethos of 100 gecs, and producer Reanna Cruz talks to the duo themselves about their eclectic sophomore record.\n\nSongs discussed: \n\n\n100 gecs – Hollywood Baby\n\n100 gecs – Billy Knows Jamie\n\n100 gecs – stupid horse\n\n100 gecs – 745 sticky\n\n100 gecs – Doritos & Fritos\n\nPrimus – Jerry Was A Racecar Driver\n\nWeen – Bananas and Blow\n\nLimp Bizkit – My Generation\n\nGorillaz – Dirty Harry\n\nFuture – I Been Drinking\n\nJ-Kwon – Tipsy\n\nJustin Timberlake – Summer Love\n\nViolent Femmes – Added Up\n\n100 gecs – Dumbest Girl Alive\n\nTHX Deep Note\n\nCypress Hill – Insane in the Membrane\n\n100 gecs – The Most Wanted Person in the United States\n\n100 gecs – Frog on the Floor\n\nAlan Jackson – Chattahoochee\n\nLimp Bizkit – Dad Vibes\n\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.

      "description": "“Kiss From a Rose” is one of the most unusual number one hits of all time. Seal’s song can’t decide if it’s in minor or major, it uses an old-fashioned waltz rhythm, and its lush orchestration and elaborate vocal harmonies support mysterious lyrics about a “greying tower alone on the sea.” Seal himself wasn’t sure about the song, and needed some convincing to include the composition on his 1994 album SEAL II. But once director Joel Schumacher decided to use the track for the end credits of the film Batman Forever, the song went global and has remained a cultural phenomenon ever since. Ahead of his upcoming 30th anniversary tour for the albums SEAL I and SEAL II, we speak with the singer and songwriter about the enduring appeal of “Kiss From A Rose.”\nLearn more about your ad choices.

      "description": "“Take Me Home, Country Roads” is a song about West Virginia, but its message of homecoming has resonance far beyond Appalachia. Songwriter and producer Ian Fitchuk found this out when he was requested to perform Denver’s music at a music festival in Tibet. Fitchuk discovered that Denver has a huge following in East and South East Asia, where Denver toured multiple times from the 70s through the 90s. Denver’s songs first came to the region through the US Armed Forces Network radio as well as a diplomatic performance for China’s leader Deng Xiaoping at the Kennedy Center in 1979. Denver performed alongside the Harlem Globetrotters and the Joffrey ballet, and he left such an impression, the show led to an invitation to be one of the first western musicians to tour China. To better understand Denver’s meaning in the region, Switched On Pop co-host Charlie Harding speaks with Ian Fitchuk about his performance and interviews journalist Jason Jeung who wrote about “Country Roads” in The Atlantic.\n\nSongs Discussed\n\nJohn Denver - Take Me Home, Country Roads\n\nKacey Musgraves - Oh, What A World\n\nThe East Is Red\n\nJohn Denver - Rocky Mountain High\n\nCreedence Clearwater Revival - Fortunate Son\n\nJames Taylor - Carolina in My Mind\n\nCarpenters - (They Long To Be) Close To You\n\nJohn Denver - Thank God I'm a Country Boy\n\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.
